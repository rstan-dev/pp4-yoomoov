## USER EXPERIENCE

   ### Purpose and target audience

YooMov is a website for people and businesses looking to hire a van and a driver to move belongings from one location to another.  An administrator can create different types of van listings in different locations, which will be displayed to a user on the front end.

A website visitor can search for van types in various locations using a filter, they can open up a detail page about each van, they can read some reviews from other customers and they can book a date for the van, or they can send an email via a contact form if they have any questions.

The user can register and login to thir User Dashboard to view, edit or delete their bookings and they can also leave feedback for any bookings that have completed.

The administrator will receive an email notification any time there is a new booking or a change to a booking, prompting them to change the status of the booking, from pending to approved or to completed. They can also review and approve feedback before it is published live on the front end.

  ### Goals
The main objectives of this website are:
1. Build an easy-to-use and navigate, fully responsive booking website, with a clean interface.
2. Create user account functionality for the administrator to add van listings and manage bookings.
3. Create a personal dashboard for a customer to login, create, view, edit and delete bookings.
4. Create a feedback module so customers and admin can leave and approve feedback.
5. Configure email to notify the customer and the administrator of any changes to bookings.


## PROJECT DESIGN

  ### Agile Approach
  From the start the project was managed using GitHub Projects, using an agile approach.
  - The project goals were broken into epics, which were broken into user stories with accceptance criteria and individual tasks.
  - Each user story was allocated a certain number of story points based on a rough estimation of time to comeplete the work.
  - This allowed me to create a roadmap with milestone and target dates.
  - Each User Story was assigned a label accordng to the MoSCoW system so I could proritise the work.

  ### Wireframes  (created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/))
   The initial wireframes were created to understand how the site would work, and this layout would drive User Stories, logic required and overall design artwork decisions.

  ### User Stories
  All epics, user stories with their acceptance criteria and tasks can be viewed on the YooMoov [GitHub Project board](https://github.com/users/rstan-dev/projects/6)

- There were 13 Epics created from Project Concept to Project Submission.

- There were 29 User Stories Created including:
  1. USERSTORY(# 1): Gather General Requirements and visual layout
    - As a developer, I can see how the site should be laid out so that the functionality can be developed incrementally.
  2. USERSTORY(#2): Initial Django project setup
    - As a developer, I can access the initial project files in my developer environment, and deploy to Heroku, so that I can resolve any deployment issues early on.




  ### Logic
   * The system was conceived using process flow diagrams created using Lucid as follows:
