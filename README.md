## USER EXPERIENCE

   ### Purpose and target audience

YooMov is a website for people and businesses looking to hire a van and a driver to move belongings from one location to another.  An administrator can create different types of van listings in different locations, which will be displayed to a user on the front end.

A website visitor can search for van types in various locations using a filter, they can open up a detail page about each van, they can read some reviews from other customers and they can book a date for the van, or they can send an email via a contact form if they have any questions.

The user can register and login to thir User Dashboard to view, edit or delete their bookings and they can also leave feedback for any bookings that have completed.

The administrator will receive an email notification any time there is a new booking or a change to a booking, prompting them to change the status of the booking, from pending to approved or to completed. They can also review and approve feedback before it is published live on the front end.

  ### Goals
The main objectives of this website are:
1. Build an easy-to-use and navigate, fully responsive booking website, with a clean interface.
2. Create user account functionality for the administrator to add van listings and manage bookings.
3. Create a personal dashboard for a customer to login, create, view, edit and delete bookings.
4. Create a feedback module so customers and admin can leave and approve feedback.
5. Configure email to notify the customer and the administrator of any changes to bookings.


## PROJECT DESIGN

  ### Agile Approach
  From the start the project was managed using GitHub Projects, using an agile approach.
  - The project goals were broken into epics, which were broken into user stories with accceptance criteria and individual tasks.
  - Each user story was allocated a certain number of story points based on a rough estimation of time to comeplete the work.
  - This allowed me to create a roadmap with milestone and target dates.
  - Each User Story was assigned a label accordng to the MoSCoW system so I could proritise the work.

  ### Wireframes  (created in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/))
   The initial wireframes were created to understand how the site would work, and this layout would drive User Stories, logic required and overall design artwork decisions.

  ### Logic
  The database schema and website logic was conceived and created using [Lucid](https://lucid.app/) as follows:

  1. Website Flow:

  2. Database Structure:
  <img src="/workspace/pp4-yoomoov/documentation/readme/yoomoov_db_schema.png">

  ### Color Scheme (created in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/))
  An orange color scheme was chosen because it's associated with optimism and energy, many brands use orange to convey a message of positivity. Many marketers use orange to get an audience excited about something becuase it is an attention-grabbing, warm color that really pops.

  I created the logo in Canva using royalty free images to cerate the distinct cow icon so there could be a play on the word YooMoov (You Moove) and chose a complimentary color pallette

   ### Imagery
   Stock Images were sourced from:
   1. Hero Photo by [Bernard Foss:](https://www.pexels.com/photo/white-vans-parked-on-gray-concrete-road-4620555/)
   2. Stock van images by [Canva Pro](https://www.canva.com/)

  - I used Canva to build the initial designs, which was the basis for finding a suitable bootstrap template that could help me achieve the look and feel as easily as possible.

   ### Typography
   I found a bootstrap layout called [Lumia](https://bootstrapmade.com/demo/Lumia/) from bootsrapmade.com which aligned closely with the layout I needed.  I kept the default Google font of Raleway and sans serif

   ### MVP
   * Using the GitHub project board I was able to prioritise user stories to give me an MVP incremetally.
   1. I built the front end as a static website first.
   2. I developed the django admin area so an administrator could manage the site
   3. I built User CRUD functionality next via their dashboard
   4. I configured on sreen notifications to give feedback to the user
   5. I built a feedback mechanism - first for the adminstrator, and then for front end users
   6. I configured email notifications to alert the user and the administrator
